# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! ♥️ Ensure your PR adheres to following guidelines:

- Search included courses before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Only add courses you think are great! Feel welcome to remove entries that you think aren't great!
- Use the following format: `[Name (Year) <🆓 or 💰>](link) - Description.`
- If you can't find the year the course was made in, you can skip adding the year.
- If the course is free, link to free course and add 🆓 emoji.
- If course if paid, link to paid course and add 💰 emoji.
- The course should be put into its appropriate category. Pick one you think is closest if you are not sure.
- If you want to add a link to notes for the course, add it to Description inbetween `()`. i.e. `(Notes[link])`
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- You can also add related links and repositories in the end.

[All suggestions are welcome](../../edit/master/readme.md).
